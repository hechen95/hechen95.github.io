Chen HE is currently a Lecturer in the [Department of Ariticial Intelligence of the College of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.swu.edu.cn/xygk/jgsz/jxxb.htm) at Southwest University in Chongqing, China.

He previously pursued his Ph.D. in the [Departement of Healthcare Engineering of the Centre for Biomedical and Healthcare Engineering](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/research/5-research-academic-centers/center-biomedical-healthcare-engineering/) at [École des Mines de Saint-Étienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/) in France, under the supervision of Professor [Xiaolan XIE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088069933) and mentorship of Assistant Professor [Benjamin DALMAS](http://www.bendalmas.com/).

After graduating from [XIDIAN University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xidian_University) (Xi'an, China) in 2016, I received two years of basic training in Computer Science at a French engineering school (also known as Écoles d'Ingénieurs in French) - [Télécom Saint-Etienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9l%C3%A9com_Saint-%C3%89tienne) (Saint-Etienne, France). In 2018, I started to specialize in the Data Science domain and enrolled in a double master's program in Data Science from [University of Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lyon) (Saint-Etienne, France). In Sept 2019, I received a master's degree in Computer Science and a double master's degree in Data Science.

Professional character and personality
======
[//]: # (I have taken the 16-personalities-test many times. The test results are sometimes ESFJ-A and sometimes ESTJ-A. )

[//]: <> (This is also a comment.)

Often, I am likely to motivate myself and my collaborators to explore and answer a new research question rather than attempt to fit the question into a preconceived mold. In other words, I prefer to be a problem solver rather than a skilled programmer or a data cruncher. I am open-minded and pragmatic about any professional issues. I'm able to communicate and cooperate with people of different personalities efficiently.

Research Topics
======
My research interests mainly lie in **Healthcare System Operation and Optimization**. The research methodology mainly comes from the following disciplines: operation research, optimization, machine learning, and data mining. <br>
Indeed, my works focus on **interpretable** analysis of a specific problem of healthcare systems and building transparent, scalable, and effective **Data Driven** models for them, from theoretical algorithms to practical applications.

**keywords**: Automation in Service System, Operation management and Optimization in Service System (i.e., Healthcare System).

Research methodology
======
Data-driven approches, operation research, optimization, machine learning, data mining and knowledge discovery, statistics, probabilty theory.
